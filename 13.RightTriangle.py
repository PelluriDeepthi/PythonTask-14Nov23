#Write a program that accepts the lengths of three sides of a triangle as inputs. The program output should indicate whether or not the triangle is a right triangle (Recall from the Pythagorean Theorem that in a right triangle, the square of one side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides)
leng = float(input("Enter the length:"))
heig = float(input("Enter the height:"))
hypo = float(input("Enter the hypotaneous:"))
if hypo**2 == ((leng**2) + (heig**2)):
  print("It's a right triangle!!!")
else:
  print("It's not a right triangle")
